    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const playersCopy = players;
    console.log(players, playersCopy);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    function check(origin, copy) {
      copy.push("Jack");
      if (origin.length !== copy.length) console.log("ne");
    }
    // check(players, playersCopy);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const playersCopy2 = players.slice();
  //  check(players, playersCopy2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const playersCopy3 = [].concat(players);
   // check(players, playersCopy3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const playersCopy4 = [...players];
   // check(players, playersCopy4);

    const playersCopy5 = Array.from(players);
    check(players, playersCopy5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const personCopy = person;
    console.log(person, personCopy);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const personCopy2 = Object.assign({}, person);

    function check2(origin, copy) {
      copy.age = 30;
      if (origin.age !== copy.age) console.log("ne");
    }
  //  check2(person, personCopy2);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const personCopy3 = {...person};
   // check2(person, personCopy3);

    const personCopy4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    check2(person, personCopy4);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
